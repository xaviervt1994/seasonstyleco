          <h4>Processing Time</h4>
          <p>
            Orders are typically processed within
            <strong>1–3 business days</strong> after payment is confirmed.
            During peak seasonal drops or holidays, processing times may be
            slightly longer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Estimated Delivery</h4>
          <p>
            Most orders arrive within <strong>7–15 business days</strong>,
            depending on your location and the specific item. Some products may
            ship separately if they come from different partner warehouses.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Tracking Your Order</h4>
          <p>
            Once your order ships, you’ll receive a confirmation email with a
            tracking link (when available). Use that link to follow your package
            as it makes its way to you.

        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Returns &amp; Exchanges</h4>
          <p>
            If something doesn’t fit or arrives not as expected, you can
            generally request a return or exchange within
            <strong>30 days</strong> of delivery, as long as the item is unused,
            unwashed, and in its original packaging.

        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Non-Returnable Items</h4>
          <p>
            For hygiene and safety reasons, certain items (such as undergarments
            or opened personal-care items) may not be returnable. Any
            non-returnable items will be clearly noted on the product page.

        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Damaged or Incorrect Items</h4>
          <p>
            If your order arrives damaged or incorrect, contact us within
            <strong>7 days</strong> of delivery with photos of the item and
            packaging. We’ll work with you to replace or refund the item as
            quickly as possible.

        <div class="info-card">
          <h4>Refunds</h4>
          <p>
            Once your return is received and inspected, we’ll notify you if your
            refund is approved. Approved refunds are issued back to your
            original payment method. Banks or card providers may take a few
            business days to post the refund.
